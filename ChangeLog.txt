Changes from 2.3.1 made November 2019  JO'N

Send-SeKeys 
  Element and keys parameters are both mandatory
  Selenium keys now cached in a script-scoped variable for performance. (Get-SEKeys can be dopped)

Valdate-URL  
   Renamed to validateUrl (private helper function does not need to use verb-noun naming and validate upsets script analyzer)

Get-SeCookie & Invoke-SeScreenshot
  Driver is renamed target, with alias "Driver", and will come from $Global:SeDriver 
  Throws an error if no driver passed or found from Global var 


New {New-SeScreenShot alias tbd} . Merges Invoke-ScreenShot and SaveSeScreenShot 
   Can pass -path, 
            -passthru (Alias PT)
            -path & -passthru
       or   -AsBase64 
   Driver is renamed target, with alias "Driver", and will come from $Global:SeDriver 
   Throws an error if no driver passed or found from Global var 


Start-Fe-Firefox & Start-SeChrome 
  Made startUrl the first parameter and added aliases "Chrome" and "Firefox" 
  User can now write in a sort or DSL CHROME $URL etc. 
  Now use parameter sets to avoid the conflict between Minimized/maximized/fullScreen, and 
  parameter validation to ensure startURL is valid
  Added parameter aliases so "Incognito" works with Firefox and "PrivateBrowsing" works with chrome
  Trap failure to return driver, raise a warning and simplified the subsequent ifs
  Added Parameter as default driver which sets $Global:SeDriver instead of returning the driver
  Removed a possible bug with piped input by not returning the driver in the end block
  Call navigate directly instead of via enter-SeURL

Start-SeEdge 
  Added startUrl, Maximized, minimized parameters & alias "MSEdge"
  Added Parameter as default driver which sets $Global:SeDriver instead of returning the driver
  Set Implicit wait to 10 seconds 

Start-SeInternetExplorer
  Added startUrl  parameter & alias "InternetExplorer"
  Added Parameter as default driver which sets $Global:SeDriver instead of returning the driver
  Set Implicit wait to 10 seconds 


NEW Open-SeURL   {replacement for enter-SEURL which would break with these changes }
  Url is first on the commandline and mandatory
  Driver is renamed target, with alias "Driver", and will come from $Global:SeDriver 
  Throws an error if no driver passed or found from Global var 

New Send-SeClick (with alias SeClick) {replacement for Invoke-SeClick}
  Element can be passed by position (first)
  JavaScriptClick can be abreviated JS 
  Driver is ignored  (element.wrapedDriver used instead)
  Added Sleep Seconds 

Get-SeElement alias seElement {replaces Find-seElement }
    a BY parameter with possible values "CssSelector", "Name", "Id", "ClassName", "LinkText", "PartialLinkText", "TagName", "XPath"
    combined witha "Selection" parameter which holds the value replaces the 8 parameters with those names and parameter Sets 
    Timeout is 0 by default and wait has been dropped. Specify a timeout of 30 instead of -wait, and timeout of 5 instead of -wait -timeout 5
    Element and Driver are merged as "target" which has aliases of Element and driver
